#Configs data (neurofield/test/data/configs/)

This directory contains output files for each of the configuration files
found in the neurofield/configs directory. They are intended to be used
as a check of consistent behaviour following code modifications.

To check that any modifications that you have made to the code haven't
inadvertently altered its functionality, run:
    
    nf_configs --check <config_file_name>

where ``nf_configs`` is a bash script found in the neurofield/test directory.

If a change to the code is made that **intentionally** modifies one of
these files then the output file should be regenerated by running:

    nf_configs --regenerate <config_file_name>

and the updated output file should be committed as part of a pull request
making the change.
