#Configs data (neurofield/test/data/configs/)

This directory contains output files for each of the configuration files
found in the neurofield/configs directory. They are intended to be used
as a check of consistent behaviour following code modifications.

To check that any modifications that you have made to the code haven't
inadvertently altered its functionality, run:
    
    nf_configs --check <config_file_name>

where ``nf_configs`` is a bash script found in the neurofield/ directory.

When a --check reveals a difference from the expected output the temporary
file used for the check is not removed, this makes it easy to look at the
difference in more detail. Once you no longer need these temporary files
you can clean them up by running:
    
    nf_configs --clean

NOTE: The output for Abeysuriya_2014 configuration files are intentionally
excluded as the output they produce is larger than all the other
configuration files in configs/ combined.

If a change to the code is made that **intentionally** modifies one of
these files then the output file should be regenerated by running:

    nf_configs --regenerate <config_file_name>

and the updated output file should be committed as part of a pull request
making the change.
