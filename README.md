### Quick start

    make
    ./Release/NeuroField -i Configs/example.conf -o example.output

1. Ensure you have a compiler that supports the `C++11` standard. We recommend GCC 4.8 or higher

2. Type `make` to build the binary `Release/NeuroField`. Example compiler commands for Mac OS and Windows are included in `makefile`. Further information about cross platform support is available in [the wiki.](https://github.com/BrainDynamicsUSYD/neurofield/wiki/Cross-platform-support)

3. The user guide is contained in [Documentation/user.pdf](https://github.com/BrainDynamicsUSYD/neurofield/blob/master/Documentation/user.pdf) which contains detailed information on how to use NeuroField.

4. Example configurations including examples for published results are available in the `Configs` folder
